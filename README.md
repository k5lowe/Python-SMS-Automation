# Python-SMS-Automation
Automate the process of sending SMS messages to multiple recipients using Python and Phone Link

## Description ##
This project automates the process of sending SMS messages to multiple recipients using Python, Phone Link, and pyautogui. The system mimics user interactions to open the Phone Link app and send messages directly from a connected phone, allowing for seamless bulk messaging without third-party APIs.

Features:
- Automated SMS sending via Phone Link
- Use of pyautogui for keyboard and mouse simulation
- Ability to send messages to multiple recipients
- Customizable message content
- Error Handling

Technologies:
- Python
- Pyautogui
- Phone Link

This tool is ideal for automating personal workflows without relying on cloud-based services.

## Notes ##
Phone Link is a Windows-based app that works only when your phone is connected to your Microsoft Windows computer. You can reduce delays in the code if needed, especially if your computer is faster than mine! The required images of the necessary buttons are available for download in the repository.
